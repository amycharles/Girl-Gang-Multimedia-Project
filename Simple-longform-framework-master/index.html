<p> Saturday 2nd May 2015. The Picture House Social ballroom has been decked out like the ultimate ‘90s prom, with glitter curtains, balloons and a photo booth for you and your prom date. On arrival goody bags were handed out, containing hand made bracelets, mix CDs and a hand made directory of creative women in Sheffield, with everything from florists to designers. The smell of fresh popcorn hung in the air while your favourite prom songs were played in the background, or perhaps the theatre group had just started another pop-up scene from Mean Girls. Workshops ran throughout the day, including corsage making and a positivity session with <a href="https://twitter.com/freehandsheff?lang=en-gb">Free Hand</a>, followed by the main event, the Ultimate Mean Girls Quiz, and of course, a screening of the cult classic. Girl Gang Sheffield was born.</p>

<p> Vahnessa Longley, a DJ and part time lecturer, with her own clothing line, approached Ellie Ragdale, who runs <a href="http://www.handmadecinema.co.uk/">Handmade Cinema</a>, to put on the Mean Girls screening to help to promote her new range of clothes. Vahnessa recalled discussing the issues faced by creative women around promoting their work with Ellie, and they realised that something was missing. </p>

<p>Vahnessa and Ellie put out this event as a stand alone, not expecting much to come of it, but as soon as the event went up on Facebook it blew up, and they realised that there was a significant gap that needed filling. Their first ever event, the Mean Girls screening won the Cinema for All Award for Best Event. </p>

<p>Now Girl Gang is a collective of self-identifying women in Sheffield who have the end goal of supporting or promoting other self-identifying women in Sheffield. They run regular art shows, screenings, music and club events, as well as meet ups and creative workshops, launching the first Girl Gang Manchester event last weekend.
</p>

<p>One of Girl Gang’s first collaborative projects was to recreate the Major Arcana Tarot Deck, with each card created by female artists from Sheffield, and was accompanied by a piece of writing or poem. Since then, the prints have been touring Sheffield as an art exhibition, as well as copies being available to buy, with all the profits going directly to the artist.

  <p>
  One of the first things that you notice about Girl Gang is the DIY nature of all the events, fliers and merchandise they sell and produce. Vanhessa predominantly puts this down to their interest in Riot Grrrls, a punk movement of the ‘90s which saw female fronted bands, as well as a confrontation of politics and sexuality, all within a DIY culture.
</p>
<p> Girl Gang also hope that all their projects are accessible to anyone to take part in, and the effort put into their work is evident.

It’s like, we have £20 and we are going to drag that £20 out and we are going to make as much as we possibly can, as sort of like a love letter from us to everybody that goes there to sort of say, we value you so much for being part of this, part of our journey, part of this collective, that we are going to spend every night for three months making things so you can see how hard we want to do it.”

<p>As it’s a feminist movement, it’s hardly surprising that they have received some backlash. Vahnessa noted that there was a clear difference in people challenging them, with some questions being very innocent, just wanting to know what they were about, and others being much more loaded.
</p>
<p> While there has been some questioning, there has been a lot of support for the women across a whole range of people, from bar owners wanting to put on their events, to the general public coming along, supporting, taking part and buying things. In particular, there have been a significant amount of men wanting to get involved and support them.

<span><i> “What we’ve found with Girl Gang is that there has been a phenomenal amount of guys that want to support us, and I think that they have used Girl Gang in the best way possible, to display to other people that they also want to support women, and it’s not this laddy culture that everyone believes in.”

  <h1>The Zine</h1>
</header>
</section>
<section class="content">
  <p>Earlier this year, Phoebe Plomer approached Girl Gang with the idea of doing a zine. They liked it so much that they gave her some start up money, and full creative control over it. In return she had to stick with the manifesto.
</p>
<p> Since then, the first edition has been published, under the theme of ‘start’, with 20 different female contributors, ranging from poetry to art, to an agony aunt column. It was printed on thick, luxurious paper, and has the feel of something special, even when you’re just holding it and looking at the cover. It was featured in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/10/what-are-zines-and-which-should-i-start-reading">The Guardian</a></span>, and has sold nearly 100 copies.
</p>
<p> Vahnessa linked the success of the zine back to why Girl Gang was originally started; by giving Phoebe their support, they've created another opportunityfor creative women in Sheffield to express themselves.

<span> <i> “There aren’t enough words to describe how proud we are of Phoebe for putting it all together, and seeing that through, and really owning that situation, I think that’s a testament to the tenacity and the creative spirit of people, it really is.”
